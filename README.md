# Leap-Year
A year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4, unless it's also divisible by 100 but not by 400. In simpler terms, a year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4, except for century years (years ending in 00) which are only leap years if they are also divisible by 400. 

Here's a breakdown of the rules:

1. Divisible by 4:
If a year is divisible by 4 (e.g., 2024, 2020), it's generally a leap year. 

2. Divisible by 100 (Century Years):
If a year is a century year (ends in 00, e.g., 1900, 2000), it's not a leap year unless it also meets rule 3.
 
3. Divisible by 400:
If a year is divisible by 400 (e.g., 2000, 2400), it is a leap year, even though it's a century year.
